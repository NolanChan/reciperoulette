If you want to run this code locally,
just make sure you have Ruby on Rails, and then install the gems in the Gemfile (with bundle install --without production), and then run "rake db:reset"
Then just run "rails s" in the root directory

If you want to run the unit + functional tests locally, just type:
  rspec

If you want to see our code on production, go here:
  http://reciperoulette.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy!
